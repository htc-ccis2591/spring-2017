# {{ page.title }}
Read Chapter 9 from your textbook *Learning JavaScript* ([errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920035534)). Chapter 9 covers object oriented programming with JavaScript.  Before diving in, you may want to review some of the basic object concepts introduced in Chapter 3 (like how the dot . operator works).

## Important Things to Note

1. Defining a new class with properties and methods (page 148)
2. Making an instance of the class and accessing its properties & methods (also page 148)
3. How `this` works within a method on a class (also page 148)
4. Inheritance/Polymorphism (pages 154-156)
4. JavaScript Prototypes (pages 151-153)


## Less important things (for now)

- Dynamic Properties (We'll cover this more in later.)
- Enumerating Properties
- Multiple Inheritance, Mixins and Interfaces
