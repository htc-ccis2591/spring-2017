Read Chapter 1-2 from your textbook *Learning JavaScript* ([errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920035534)). Chapter 1 covers an introduction to JavaScript through the creation of a rather spiffy "Hello World" web project, while Chapter 2 focuses on commonly used JavaScript tools.

## Hello World Project
This reading has you creating a rather spiffy "Hello World" project which you can version and push up to GitHub.  Since this is a "new" project from scratch, this also teaches you how to put something new which you create yourself (instead of forking an existing project) onto GitHub.

While this is way beyond a traditional boring hello world, and the code isn't discussed in huge detail, it's a pretty fun project to get you started.  Focus more on forrest here than the trees.  The details of the fancy graphic code and all is not important right now.  I won't expect you to reproduce this from scratch yourself.   

## Tools
Try not to let the tools overwhelm you. It's a lot of information to get started with, but while this can feel like a heavy chapter we'll work with these tools repeatedly to get you comfortable with them over time.
