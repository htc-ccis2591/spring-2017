# {{ page.title }}
Read Chapter 1 from your textbook *Learning JavaScript* ([errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920035534)). Chapter 1 covers an introduction to JavaScript through the creation of a rather spiffy "Hello World" web project.

## Hello World Project
While this is way beyond a traditional boring hello world, and the code isn't discussed in huge detail, it's a pretty fun project to get you started.  Focus more on forrest here than the trees.  The details of the fancy graphic code and all is not important right now.  I won't expect you to reproduce this from scratch yourself.   

You can check out the *fancy* Hello World on GitHub:

The chapter introduces you to git as well.  Since this is a "new" project from scratch, there are some additional things you need to know to get this onto GitHub, since there is no existing project to fork.

First, you need to create a new repository.  
{% include img-medium.html url="/morea/hello-javascript/images/github-new-repo1.png"
    alt="Screenshot of creating a new repository in GitHub."
%}

Once you have the new repository setup, they will give you commands to use to get your local files pushed up to the new GitHub remote repository.
