We'll use npm (node package manager) to get JavaScript related tools and libraries.  It is a part of NodeJS which is becoming a ubiquitous tool in the JavaScript developers world.  While we'll mainly use npm, NodeJS also allows development and testing of back-end JavaScript code.

## Install
If you have not already done so, download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) website.  Once you have completed the download, run the installer.
