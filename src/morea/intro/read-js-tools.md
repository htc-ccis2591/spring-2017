Read Chapter 2 from your textbook *Learning JavaScript* ([errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920035534)) which covers an introduction to common JavaScript tools.

Try not to let the tools overwhelm you. It's a lot of information to get started with, but while this can feel like a heavy chapter we'll work with these tools repeatedly to get you comfortable with them over time.
