# Install Configure, and Use Brackets
Let's walk through how to install, configure and use Brackets.  
{%  include youtube-small.html  id="_MXzMRgPnvs" %}

## Install
If you have not already done so, download Brackets from the [Brackets.io](http://brackets.io/) website.  Once you have completed the download, run the installer.  

Brackets Live Preview relies on the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) browser.  If you do not already have this installed, download and install it from the web. If you do, check that you have the latest version and update if you do not.  

## Configure
After the install has completed, run Brackets and use the extension manager to install the following extensions:  

- Beautify (by Drew Hamlett)
- HTMLHint (by Raymond Camden)
- CSSLint (by Raymond Camden)
- Pop-up Menu Brackets (by Denisov21) *__optional__*

## Tips for Use

### Always Open a Folder
When working with Brackets for web development, it is very important that you open and work with a folder of files.  Because there is an actual web server behind the editor, it expects that you have a root folder for your website.  If this root folder has not been opened, you can see errors when using auto-complete and live-preview.

Even if you only have a single file, create a folder for that web site.  In addition to preventing errors in Brackets, this facilitates growth of the web site later on.

### Use Live Preview
The Live Preview feature is an excellent tool for learning.  If you watch the changes to your website as you edit your files, it can help solidify your understanding of how HTML and CSS work together.  Live preview relies on the Chrome Browser being installed.
