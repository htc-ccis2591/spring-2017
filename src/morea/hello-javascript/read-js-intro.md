## History of JavaScript
JavaScript started out its life as Mocha, then it became LiveScript. It was officially released by Netscape as JavaScript in 1995. It picked up the “Java” part of its name at that point to ride on the growing popularity of Java.  But it's *not* Java. They are two completely different unrelated languages. There are no links between them except that word in the name.  

In 1996, it Netscape submitted it to ECMA an international standards organization. The standard that came out of this is called ECMAScript. ECMAScript is a programming language standard. It is what the web browsers support, but it isn't a programming language itself. JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript.

ECMAScript version 5 (ES5) was published in 2011, and it is supported almost universally across today’s web browsers. On the other hand, ES6 is relatively new (June 2015).  It is less widely supported right now, but many browsers support at least part of that standard.  

Where it makes sense, we'll be working with the new language features from ES6. The new ES6 standard includes major enhancements to the JS language. We'll learn to use trans-compilers to convert our ES6 code to the ES5 standard that is more widely supported in the browsers.  

## Core Tools
1. Browser
  - Chrome - class standard (lecture/grading)
  - Firefox - discussed in book
2. TextEditor
  - Brackets - useful for Live Preview feature
  - Atom or any other programmer’s editor is also fine
3. Git & GitHub
4. Shell (GitBash, Powershell or Terminal)
5. Node
  - Provides local Web Server
  -Also provides npm a package manager
6. Gulp - build tool, automates tasks
7. Babel - transpiler
8. ESLint - helps catch mistakes in your code
