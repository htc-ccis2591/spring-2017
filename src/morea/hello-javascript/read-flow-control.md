Read Chapter 4 from your textbook *Learning JavaScript* ([errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920035534)). Chapter 4 covers flow control in JavaScript:

- while loops
- if else statements
- do while loops
- for loops & *fancy* for loops
- break & continue
- switch statements

Focus on getting down how to write the structures you already know from previous programming experiences in JavaScript first.  There is a lot of reading here, but the concepts should already be familiar.

Focus on these 3 key structures:
- while loops
- if else statements
- for loops

You can do everything you need to do with these.  

Then add on to this as you feel comfortable with doing so.  The additional loop structures and the switch statement can be useful in certain situation to cut down on the amount of code you need to write and make it easier to read and understand.  However it is perfectly possible to never use them.
